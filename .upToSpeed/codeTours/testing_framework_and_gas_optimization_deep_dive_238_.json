Compare new test results with these baselines to identify gas cost changes.\n2. Increases in gas costs may indicate potential inefficiencies introduced by new code.\n3. Decreases suggest successful optimizations.\n\nTry running 'yarn test' and compare your results with these snapshots.

Use of assembly for low-level operations (see contracts/UniversalRouter.sol)\n2. Efficient storage packing (examine contracts/UniversalRouter.sol)\n3. Loop optimizations in critical paths (look at contracts/modules/Uniswap.sol)\n\nThese strategies work together to minimize gas consumption across the entire contract.","file":"contracts/libraries/Commands.sol","highlight":[{"start":7,"end":10}],"title":"","id":"2172"},{"type":"textOnly","description":"Let's put your understanding into practice with a hands-on exercise:\n\n1.

Examine the output, focusing on the 'gasUsed' value in the snapshot.\n\n3. Now, think critically:\n   - How does this gas usage compare to other operations you're familiar with?\n   - What factors in the swap might be contributing to this gas cost?\n   - Can you identify any potential areas for optimization?\n\nThis exercise demonstrates how the testing framework quantifies gas usage, a crucial aspect of optimization in Ethereum smart contracts.
