When this flag is set, it indicates that the command is allowed to revert without causing the entire transaction to fail. This is useful for optional operations or fallback scenarios.","title":"","id":"2121"},{"type":"highlight","description":"The COMMAND_TYPE_MASK (0x3f) is used to extract the actual command type from the command byte:","file":"contracts/libraries/Commands.sol","highlight":[{"start":9,"end":9}],"title":"","id":"2122"},{"type":"textOnly","description":"In practice, the command byte is composed as follows:\n\n1. The lower 6 bits (0x3f) represent the command type.\n2. The 7th bit is currently unused.\n3. The most significant bit (0x80) is the FLAG_ALLOW_REVERT.\n\nFor example, a command byte might look like this:\n0b10000001 (0x81)\n\nHere, the FLAG_ALLOW_REVERT is set (1), and the command type is 0x01 (V3_SWAP_EXACT_OUT).\n\nTo extract the command type, the contract would use:\ncommandType = commandByte & COMMAND_TYPE_MASK\n\nAnd to check if revert is allowed:\nrevertAllowed = (commandByte & FLAG_ALLOW_REVERT) != 0\n\nThis efficient encoding allows for up to 64 different command types and a revert flag, all within a single byte.","title":"","id":"2123"},{"type":"highlight","description":"Command types are strategically organized into groups to optimize gas usage during execution. This grouping enables the use of nested if blocks in the contract's execution logic, significantly reducing gas consumption.\n\nEach group of commands is processed within a specific if block, allowing the contract to quickly determine which block to execute based on the command type. For example, commands 0x00 to 0x07 are processed in the first if block, 0x08 to 0x0f in the second, and so on.\n\nThis structure means that for any given command, the contract only needs to evaluate a few conditions to determine the correct execution path, rather than checking against every possible command type. As a result, gas costs are minimized, especially for frequently used commands placed in earlier blocks.","file":"contracts/libraries/Commands.sol","highlight":[{"start":13,"end":73}],"title":"","id":"2114"},{"type":"highlight","description":"Now, let's look at how the UniversalRouter contract processes these commands.","file":"contracts/UniversalRouter.sol","highlight":[{"start":45,"end":76}],"title":"","id":"2115"},{"type":"highlight","description":"The Dispatcher contract handles the actual execution of commands. Let's see how it decodes and routes different command types.","file":"contracts/base/Dispatcher.sol","highlight":[{"start":44,"end":129}],"title":"","id":"2116"},{"type":"highlight","description":"Let's examine a concrete example of how the V3_SWAP_EXACT_IN command is encoded and used in a transaction.\n\nThe V3_SWAP_EXACT_IN command (0x00) might be encoded like this:\n\n0x00 (command byte)\n+ 0000...1111 (20 bytes, recipient address)\n+ 000...0de0b6b3a7640000 (32 bytes, amountIn of 1 ETH in wei)\n+ 000...0de0b6b3a7640000 (32 bytes, amountOutMin)\n+ <path data> (variable length)\n+ 01 (1 byte, payerIsUser boolean)\n\nThis encoded command is then included in the 'inputs' array of the execute function. The corresponding command byte (0x00) is added to the 'commands' string.\n\nWhen processed, the Dispatcher extracts these parameters and calls v3SwapExactInput with the decoded values. This demonstrates how the command encoding allows complex operations to be efficiently packed into a single transaction.","file":"contracts/base/Dispatcher.sol","highlight":[{"start":45,"end":60}],"title":"","id":"2117"},{"type":"highlight","description":"The RoutePlanner is a crucial part of the command encoding process, working alongside the UniversalRouter and Dispatcher. It's used to construct sequences of commands that will be executed by the UniversalRouter. Let's examine its key components:\n\n- The `addCommand` method encodes individual commands, including their type and parameters.\n- The `addSubPlan` method allows for nested command sequences, enhancing flexibility.\n- The `createCommand` function encodes command inputs according to their ABI definition.\n\nBy using RoutePlanner, complex transaction sequences can be efficiently encoded before being passed to the UniversalRouter for execution. This abstraction simplifies the process of creating multi-step transactions while ensuring they're properly formatted for the command encoding mechanism we've explored.","file":"test/integration-tests/shared/planner.ts","highlight":[{"start":117,"end":152}],"title":"","id":"2118"},{"type":"textOnly","description":"The command encoding mechanism in UniversalRouter allows for efficient and flexible execution of complex transactions.
